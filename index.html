	  <h1>{{ "Hello World!" | downcase}}</h1>
	  <p>I am a junior undergraduate student at Yale College majoring in Astrophysics with a certificate in Intensive Education Studies. My broad research interests are in planetary atmospheres and astrobiology. Currently, I'm working on ice giant atmospheres with TESS and telluric noise subtraction to reduce CRIRES+ exoplanet transit spectra. </p>
	  <p>I am proudly a first-generation, low-income (FGLI) college student, and am passionate about expanding access to college, particularly in the sciences. </p>
